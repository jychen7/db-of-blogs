# db-of-tech-sharing

Hi there, this repo is an experiment to use Github "Issues" to collect technical sharing (e.g. blogs, slides, tech talks, etc). Each "issue" is a sharing with labels of company/author and technologies.

## Contribution?

Sure! Feel free to create a "Issue". I will help append the labels.

## Questions? Discussion?

Please do not create "Issue" for question or discussion. Feel free to use "Discussions" instead.
